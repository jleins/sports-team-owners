Hi,
This is intended to show the network connections between the four major US sports leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL), teams, their owners, and the owner's core business.

I built this data in Gephi and exported it to sports.graphml. I'm using it to learn pyvis and D3.

Hopefully, if I have the time, I intend to:
1. flesh out the ownership and team data, including founding year and more complete business details
2. develop D3 script to polish and add interactivity like search, filters, menus, collapseable nodes
3. fix proportions, gravity settings
4. highlight key items, intersections, facts
